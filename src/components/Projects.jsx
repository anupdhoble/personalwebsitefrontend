                Our project addresses the challenge of small datasets by employing <b>ResNet50</b> as a transfer learning model. Model is trained on CEDAR data set which has a collection of >2000 signatures. Deployed on <b>Django</b> for the backend and <b>React.js</b> for the frontend, our solution offers seamless integration and user-friendly interaction. Additionally, the app supports signature storage for future training, ensuring scalability and continuous improvement.

                The Activity Tracker <b>Chrome Extension</b> is a powerful tool that helps users monitor users browsing activity by tracking the time spent on different webpages. The backend, built using <b>Ruby on Rails</b> and deployed on Render, seamlessly integrates with the extension to store and manage user data, leveraging an <b>SQLite</b> database for efficient data handling. This project showcases my skills in web development, API creation, and database management, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
